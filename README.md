# KernelBruteforcer
 Implementation of the fast search method for large polarization kernels. Now it is considered for publication in IEEE Transactions on Communications. The algorithm is also described in my PhD thesis "Methods for design and decoding of polar codes with
large kernels" https://dissovet.itmo.ru/dissertation/?number=715759

## Build

The sources can be built with Visual Studio 2017

## Running

Kernels are output to separate txt files

### Example usage
```
BlockKernelBruteforcer.exe -c c24.txt -f AWS -b 3
